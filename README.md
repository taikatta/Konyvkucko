# Könyvkuckó - Hungarian children's books in Deansgrange Library!

This is my first Milestone Project on the Full Stack Web Developer Code Institute course.

I moved to Ireland 5 years ago and since then every time we visit back to Hungary my luggage is packed with Hungarian books. I had an idea of launching a Hungarian Library somewhere in Dublin. Last year I applied for a grant, as a first step I wanted to buy only children's books. The collection is about 120 books by now and it is growing, i got books from authors, organizations, individuals. The launch of the Hungarian children's book will be on the 29th oc October, 2019.

Please note, that although the website contains a form, information entered into the fields will not feed anywhere, as the scope of the project does not include any back-end functionality.

## UX

The website is for Hungarian families living in Ireland and would like to inform users about the selection of Hungarian books available to borrow.

The books are hosted by Deansgrange Library, but they can be requested via the inter-library loans system from other libraries who are part of Libraries Ireland. The requested books will be delivered to the users local library.

## Technologies
